<p>Created a simple 3D rendering program from scratch using only C++ and no graphics library. A predecessor of the Reactor Engine project.</p>

<p>I wanted to get deeper understanding of what kind of mathematics is used behind 3D rendering techniques, and decided to build a rendering engine of my own. At the end, by expanding this project into a game engine (Reactor Engine), I was able to grasp a thorough understanding of 3D graphics.</p>
