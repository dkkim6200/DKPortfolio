<p>Working at virtro, I developed an internal employee management software. It used Node.JS and Express to create a REST API that communicated with the Slack server to provide Slack-based UI for viewing punchcards and signing up.</p>

<p>I also helped optimize <i>The Station</i>, a Sci-Fi indie game, to PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive. My main job was to optimize the real-time lighting to baked ones to reduce the heavy computing load.</p>
