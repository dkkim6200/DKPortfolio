  Using Tensorflow's RNN and the data scraped from <a href="http://officequotes.net/">officequotes.net</a>, I have created a fake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)">"The Office"</a> script generator. A character-based RNN prediction was used to repeatedly generate the next character based on the previous 100 characters. Despite the model's relative lack of knowledge in characters that were generated long ago compared to other NLP models, after 10 iterations of training, the model yielded a fairly close (and humourous) approximation of the original script.
