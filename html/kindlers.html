<p>Created a web application to register new members, sign up online for volunteer opportunities, and display well-formatted list of volunteer events and hours of each member for my school's Kindler's Society (NGO for donating English books to the third-world children).</p>

<p>Login and sign-up system was implemented with PHP and MySQL, and AJAX to update the volunteer event status.</p>

<p>Other functionality include executive-only volunteer event posting, as well as managing volunteer hours of the general members.</p>
