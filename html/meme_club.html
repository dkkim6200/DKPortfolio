  As the president and the head mentor of my high school engineering club, I taught a team of 20 to build a distance sensor for the rear of a car to help when parking. It reports the distance between the wall and the car to the driver every second. For me, it was an amazing opportunity to lead and collaborate with a large group of people to produce a solution to problem that we encounter everyday.
