<p>Created Unity-styled game engine using only C++ and OpenGL. It implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system">entity-component-system</a> to structure the game objects and their interactions. It was built with multi-platform implementation in mind, thus the system-specific part of the engine (accessing file, user input, etc.) has been carefully seperated from other parts.</p>

<p>While using other game engines like Unity and Unreal, I wanted to have a thorough understanding of their inner-workings, so I decided to make a game engine of my own. It is one of the most challenging project I have taken on, yet it was very statisfying to work with.</p>
