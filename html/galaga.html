<p>Developed iOS clone of "Galaga", one of the most famous retro-game of all time. Used Objective-C for the UI side, and C++ for the game's main logic for the ease of development.</p>

<p>Although the code has been lost now, the original version included a login system with Tomcat Java Servlet server, and HP & Score system included with the game. The smooth motion of the enemies were created using Blender's Bezier curve function, and converting the baked coordinates of the curve into a data file containing 2D vectors using my custom python utility program.</p>
