<p>At Hack the North (<a href='https://hackthenorth.com/'>Website</a>), my team and I have recreated the <i>Wizard Chess</i> of the Harry Potter series in VR. We used IBM Watson's Speech-to-text API to detect the user's command for giving orders to the chess pieces. Our team became the finalist of Hack the North 2018.</p>
